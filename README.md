sling-git
=========

sling
-----
Time is money and sometimes, you want to save everything and push,
_now_; or sometimes you want to stop where you are and pull,
_now_.

So you want to `sling`. Or `slang`. Or if you're really fancy,
you'll `slingslang` from here, to there. That's what sling-git
does.

scatter
-------
`scatter` will sling all local repos to their origin remote,
without forcing any other repos to pull. `scetter` will do the
same thing, but pull instead of push.

Usage
-----
By default, the current directory is used as the source of an operation.
``sling [repo]``
``slang [repo]``
``slingslang [repo1] [repo2]``

``scatter [dir]``
``scetter [dir]``
